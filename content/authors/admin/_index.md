Hi! I'm Ingrid. I am a junior at Reed College, where I am majoring in biology and minoring in French. I am an educational technology consultant in the mLab, where I help students and faculty with various data projects. I love creating maps as well as effective/gorgeous/interesting data visualizations. I am passionate about data education and making coding/learning how to work with data more accessible and effective. 

In my free time, I can be found baking bread, knitting, or messing around with different color palettes in R.
